In this game, the objective is to click on the shapes on the screen until they are all the same. If you can achieve this goal within the time limit you win, if not, you lose.

The shapes that appear on the screen after clicking the start button will be randomly generated and will be moving to random locations on the screen. 

When you click on a square, it will turn into a triangle. A triangle will then turn into a circle if you click on it and a circle will turn into a square. 

I plan on creating this game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The problems I anticipate running into include, making a way to cycle through the different shape types and creating a way of linking up the timer and the game.
