# Project 1 WDI Dan Gillen, Click Those Shapes!

## Instructions

In this game, the objective is to change the shape of each floating object to one uniform shape. You do this by clicking on the existing randomly generated shapes.

To start the game off, the player will click the **start** button. Upon clicking the start button, several shapes will randomly generate and will be moving in random directions around the screen.

The player must then click on the shapes to change their form so that they are all the same shape. When the player clicks on a square it will turn into a triangle, a triangle will turn into a circle, and a circle will turn into a square. If you can match up the shapes within the time limit you win. If not, you lose.

## MVP

- Create a way to cycle through the shape types
- Create a winning condition
- Create a timer thanks links up with the winning condition

## Secondary MVP

- Create a second level if the player wins with more objects

## Obstacles

The problems I anticipate running into include:
- Making a way to cycle through the different shape types  
- Creating a way of linking up the timer and the game
- Figuring out how to create the winning condition.

## Solutions

In order to overcome these potential problems, I plan on using online resources such as [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). In addition to these resources, I intend to seek out help from peers and instructors alike.
